# project_hecate

## Overview 

We propose a Self navigating package delivery robot, capable of finding an optimized route between logistic stations and deliver mobile parts like electric circuits, motherboards, screens and similar embedded parts from the manufacturing unit to the assembly line, in large factory units, like the Apple’s factory in China. Such autonomous robotic system with inherent artificial intelligence to find it’s way in factories and avoid collisions while traversing, will yield big returns to Acme robotics.
